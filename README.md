## Tube Archivist Jellyfin Integration
Import your Tube Archivist media folder into Jellyfin

![home screenshot](assets/screenshot-home.png?raw=true "Jellyfin Home")

This repo looks for regular contributors. If this is a useful integration, consider improving upon it.   

This requires Tube Archivist v0.4.0 or later for API compatibility.

## Core functionality
- Import each YouTube channel as a TV Show
- Each year will become a Season of that Show
- Load artwork and additional metadata into Jellyfin

## How does that work?
At the core, this links the two APIs together: This first queries the Jellyfin API for YouTube videos for any videos that don't have metadata to then populate the required fields from Tube Archivist. Then as a secondary step this will transfer the artwork.

This doesn't depend on any additional Jellyfin plugins, that is a stand alone solution.

This is a *one way* sync, syncing metadata from TA to Jellyfin. This syncs in particular:
- Video title
- Video description
- Video date published
- Channel name
- Channel description

## Setup Jellyfin

Take a look at the example docker-compose.yml provided.

0. Add the Tube Archivist **/youtube** folder as a media folder for Jellyfin.
    - IMPORTANT: This needs to be mounted as **read only** aka `ro`, otherwise this will mess up Tube Archivist.  

1. Add a new media library to your Jellyfin server for your Tube Archivist videos, required options:
    - Content type: `Shows`
    - Displayname: `YouTube`
    - Folder: Root folder for Tube Archivist videos
    - Deactivate all Metadata downloaders
    - Automatically refresh metadata from the internet: `Never`
    - Deactivate all Image fetchers

2. Let Jellyfin complete the library scan
    - This works best if Jellyfin has found all media files and Tube Archivist isn't currently downloading.
    - At first, this will add all channels as a Show with a single Season 1.
    - Then this script will populate the metadata.

3. Backdrops
    - In your Jellyfin installation under > *Settings* > *Display* > enable *Backdrops* for best channel art viewing experience.

## Install with Docker
An example configuration is provided in the docker-compose.yml file. Configure these environment variables:
  - `TA_URL`: Full URL where Tube Archivist is reachable
  - `TA_TOKEN`: Tube Archivist API token, accessible from the settings page
  - `JF_URL`: Full URL where Jellyfin is reachable
  - `JF_TOKEN`: Jellyfin API token
  - `JF_FOLDER`: Folder override if your folder is not named "YouTube" on your Filesystem.
  - `LISTEN_PORT`: Optionally change the port where the integration is listening for messages. Defaults to `8001`. If you change this, make sure to also change the json link for auto trigger as described below.

Mount the `/youtube` folder from Tube Archivist also in this container at `/youtube` to give this integration access to the media archive.

### Manual trigger
For an initial import or for other irregular occasions, trigger the library scan from outside the container, e.g.:
```bash
docker exec tubearchivist-jf python main.py
```

### Auto trigger
Use the notification functionality of Tube Archivist to automatically trigger a library scan whenever the download task completes in Tube Archivist. For the `Start download` schedule on your settings page add a json Apprise link to send a push notification to the `tubearchivist-jf` container on task completion, make sure to specify the port, e.g.:

```
json://tubearchivist-jf:8001
```


## Install Standalone
1. Install required libraries for your environment, e.g.
```bash
pip install requests
```
2. rename/copy *config.sample.json* to *config.json*.
3. configure these keys:
	- `ta_video_path`: Absolute path of your /youtube folder from Tube Archivist
	- `ta_url`: Full URL where Tube Archivist is reachable
	- `ta_token`: Tube Archivist API token, accessible from the settings page
	- `jf_url`: Full URL where Jellyfin is reachable
	- `jf_token`: Jellyfin API token
    - `jf_folder`: Name of the folder where TubeArchivist puts the files into

Then run the script from the main folder with python, e.g.
```python
python app/main.py
```

## Limitations
You can only have *one* folder called **YouTube** in your Jellyfin.

Jellyfin needs to be able to see the temporary season folders created by this extensions. You will see messages like `waiting for seasons to be created` before you will run into a `TimeoutError`, if that doesn't happen in a reasonable time frame.

Some ideas for why that is:
- Your JF busy, too slow or is already refreshing another library and is not picking up the folder in time.
- JF doesn't have the permissions to see the folder created by the extension.
- You didn't mount the volumes as expected and JF is looking in the wrong place.
